# K-Means-Clustering
In this project, I have implemented K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to partition a given dataset into 4 distinct clusters.
K-Means works by assigning data points to clusters based on their similarity, where each cluster is represented by its centroid. The algorithm iterates through two main steps: assigning each data point to the nearest centroid, and then recalculating the centroids based on the new assignments. 
This process continues until convergence, i.e., when the assignments no longer change.

This is a supermarket mall data and through membership cards, we have some basic data about customers like Customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. 
Spending Score is something assigned to the customer based on defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.
Forming clusters of customers by applying K-means clustering.

Conclusion: The K-Means algorithm successfully partitioned the data into 4 clusters, providing meaningful insights. By examining the characteristics of each cluster, we were able to identify patterns and groupings in the data that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.
